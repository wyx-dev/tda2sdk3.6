(See the file<BR>ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part<BR>of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than<BR>the foregoing paragraphs do.<BR><BR>The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.<BR>It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.<BR>The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,<BR>ltconfig, ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright<BR>by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.<BR><BR>It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by<BR>patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.  Hence arithmetic coding cannot<BR>legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.  For this reason,<BR>support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software.<BR>(Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented<BR>Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.)<BR>So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining<BR>code.<BR><BR>The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.<BR>To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has<BR>been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce<BR>"uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the<BR>resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard<BR>GIF decoders.<BR><BR>We are required to state that<BR>    "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of<BR>    CompuServe Incorporated.
