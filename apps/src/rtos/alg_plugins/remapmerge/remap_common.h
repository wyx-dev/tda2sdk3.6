  @struct RemapMaps

  @brief  This structure defines the parameters to do LUT conversion from
        frame based LUT to block based LUT

  @param  srcMap [In]: srcMap points to an input array of (x,y) coordinates in
        float or uint32 - this is frame level LUT

  @param mapDim [In] : width and height of the coordinate map pointed by the above
        srcMap, which are also the destination ROI's width and height

  @param  srcImageDim [In]; Dimensions of the source image, doesn't need to be
         same as mapDim and usually are larger

  @param  isSrcMapFloat [In]: Is srcMap floating point ? Floating point vs Uint32
          will result in slower execution of however advantage is that the qShift
          doesn’t need to be fixed beforehand

  @param  srcFormat [In]: source format: Refer enumeration Format

  @param  outputBlockDim [In]: output block dimensions
          which must divide mapDim.width and mapDim.height .
          Width must be multiple of 16 bytes
  @param  blockMap [In/Out]
          pointer to block-partitioned map of indexes in Q format. The convertMap
          routine shall populate this buffer in below format
          RemapBlockInfo of Block0 followed by Linear LUT for Block0 followed by
          RemapBlockInfo of Block1 followed by Linear LUT for Block1
          ... and so on
          This buffer is allocated by the user of covert_map routine and expected size is
          (sizeof(RemapBlockInfo) + 2*outputBlockDim.width*outputBlockDim.height) *
          ( 2  + (mapDim.width * mapDim.height) / (outputBlockDim.width * outputBlockDim.height))

  @param  qShift [In]
          Number of fractional bits used to represent Q-numbers pointed by srcMap

  @param  maxInputBlockDim [Out]: worst case input block dimensions
          It helps for remap routine to do a worst case memory allocation

  @param  maxInputBlockSize [Out]: worst case input block size
          It helps for remap routine to do a worst case memory allocation
