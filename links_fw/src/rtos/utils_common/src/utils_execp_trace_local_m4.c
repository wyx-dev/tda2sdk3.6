 * \brief Implementation for Exception Trace
 *
 *        By default, when an exception occurs, an ExcContext structure is
 *        allocated on the ISR stack and filled in within the exception handler
 *        If excContextBuffer is initialized by the user, the ExcContext
 *        structure will be placed at that address instead. The buffer must be
 *        large enough to contain an ExcContext structure.
 *
 *        By default, when an exception occurs, a pointer to the base address
 *        of the stack being used by the thread causing the exception is used.
 *        If excStackBuffer is initialized by the user, the stack contents of
 *        the thread causing the exception will be copied to that address
 *        instead. The buffer must be large enough to contain the largest task
 *        stack or ISR stack defined in the application.
 *
 * \param   excCtx [IN]
 *
 * \return  None
